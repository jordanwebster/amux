/// Everything a fleet row can say about itself, in one closed set.
///
/// It exists because the answer used to be spread across four places that
/// nothing reconciled: the agent's attention, whether this build can read its
/// provider, whether the machine that owns it has answered, and whether that
/// machine is online at all. The list row and the sentence VoiceOver reads
/// each recombined a different subset by hand, so no single
/// place said what a row could be — which is how two marks in the vocabulary
/// came to mean nothing without anybody noticing.
///
/// The marks are gone. A row draws one thing, the accent dot beside its age,
/// for the one state that is waiting on a person; everything else is said in
/// words on the third line, where `Idle` and `Finished · 4 files · +118 −40`
/// already were.
/// A word is more precise than a glyph and needs no vocabulary learnt first.
