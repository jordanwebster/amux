/// says SwiftUI cannot do the job: a transcript that scrolls at the display's
/// cadence, a field that lays out attachment tokens inline, a diff that
/// selects a range of lines under a finger.

/// here, and justified by a written measurement. `apps/apple/Tools/feature-lint.sh`
/// refuses UIKit anywhere else in this package, so the list here is the whole
/// of it and nobody has to go looking.

/// measurement is about to be taken for.
