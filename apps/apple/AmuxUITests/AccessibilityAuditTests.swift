/// Every control this app draws, checked for the two things a control has to
/// have before anybody can use it without looking at it: a name VoiceOver can
/// read out, and enough of it to hit.
///
/// It is a UI test rather than something the app asks itself, and it has to
/// be. SwiftUI builds an accessibility tree only for an attached accessibility
/// client, and an app is not one from inside its own process: asked from in
/// there, every control answers with no traits at all and nothing can be told
/// from a label. XCUITest is that client, so the element kind, the name and
/// the rectangle read here are the ones VoiceOver and a thumb would get.
///
/// The pages it audits are live ones, reached the way a person reaches them:
/// `scripts/ios-accessibility.py` serves machines with agents that act, pairs
/// the app with one by its code and taps through to each page, then asks this
/// test to audit what is on screen. The two take turns through files in a
/// directory both can see, named in `AMUX_AUDIT_DIRECTORY`: the driver writes
/// `page-N.json` saying which page is up and where the app's door listens,
/// this test audits it and answers `page-N.done`, and `end` says there are no
/// more.
///
/// One kind of thing is judged on its name and not on its size: a link the
/// markdown parser made out of a run of an agent's prose. That is not a control
/// the app draws. The app draws a paragraph; the parser turns a span of a
/// sentence inside it into something tappable, laid out as part of a line and
/// split across two of them when the line wraps. There is no rectangle to grow,
/// and its height is the height of the prose around it. WCAG's target-size rule
/// carves out inline targets in a sentence for exactly this reason, so the
/// exception here is the standard's rather than this app's. It is kept narrow:
/// only a link with no identifier of its own, sitting inside a block of agent
/// prose, and only its size is excused — it must still say something VoiceOver
/// can read out. Each one excused is written into the record with the state it
/// was found in, its label and its URL, and counted in the run's summary line,
/// so a small tappable thing nobody expected is reported rather than lost.
