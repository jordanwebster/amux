# iPhone copy

Write the words a person needs to use the app. Controls name actions; status
lines state facts; failure descriptions explain what the person can do next.
Provider output, names, paths, commands and the person's own text stay verbatim.

## Case and length

Use Title Case for navigation titles, tabs, buttons, menu items and settings
rows: **New Agent**, **Sign In**, **Add to Review**, **Model and Effort**. Small
words within a title stay lowercase, and names keep their spelling, as in
**Start on Studio** and **Continue on amux.sh**.

Use sentence case for headlines, section heads, descriptions, captions,
placeholders and status lines: **No hosts yet**, **Needs you**, **Message
refactor-auth**, **Reconnecting · last update 2m ago**. Identifiers, commands,
model names and paths keep their original case and use the mono face.

A button is a verb or a verb and its object, normally at most 3 words unless
it includes a name. A description is one sentence and earns its place only
when the control does not explain itself. State a destructive action's actual
consequences. Do not add reassurance or describe implementation choices.

## Terms and punctuation

| Thing | Use |
| --- | --- |
| A computer running amux | host |
| An agent awaiting a response or review | needs you |
| The account service | account |
| What a subscription provides | relay |
| Adding a host | pair |
| Leaving an account or ending a device's access | sign out / revoke |
| The debug bundle | report |
| A plan you do not accept | send back |

Use second person and present tense. An agent or host is *it*. Avoid hedging,
filler and exclamation marks. Use digits for numbers, a middle dot between
facts on one line, curly quotes and a proper ellipsis (…). Full sentences end
with full stops; status fragments do not. Do not use em dashes, semicolons,
pipes or slashes as prose separators. Preserve punctuation inside verbatim
commands and provider/user content.

## Reviewing a copy change

`timeout 300 wt run ios-lint` runs the copy inventory and its failure probes
alongside the feature architecture checks. It runs without Xcode or a
simulator. The English catalogue is
`ios/Amux/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`. Debug report copy is in
`AmuxTestSupport/Sources/AmuxTestSupport/Resources/DebugCopy.xcstrings` and its
resource directory is excluded from Release.

Update the source and the catalogue together. Each catalogue entry has its
English value and a comment locating its uses. Swift interpolation is shown
as `%@` slots for review; the expression and its fallback literals are checked
separately. These catalogues inventory the app's English copy. They do not
declare support for translated locales or infer localized number/plural
formatting from Swift expressions. Copy returned by models and helpers is
reviewed just like text written directly in a view.

The checker scans all Swift sources in the app and every package, including
debug report views. Raw strings, multiline strings and strings inside
interpolation are included. It refuses any new nonempty literal until it
appears in the appropriate catalogue or receives an exact non-copy exemption
in `ios/Tools/noncopy.json`. An exemption names its file, literal, surrounding
source, occurrence count and reason. It is for protocol fields, asset names,
formatting, harness diagnostics and verbatim fixture content. It is never a
way to approve interface copy. Reusing an exempt protocol key as a new label,
moving its use or leaving a stale exemption fails the check.

There is no automatic inventory refresh. Review the literal's use before
adding or changing an exemption. The lint enforces coverage and the mechanical
punctuation rules; a reviewer still checks case, clarity, consequences and
whether externally supplied text is being preserved accurately. Review
catalogue entries as complete rendered phrases where views combine them.

After a visible change, inspect both appearances and any affected small or
accessibility layouts, update only the relevant goldens, explain departures
in `ios/Goldens/BASELINE.md`, and run an ordinary comparison. Report descriptions
must match the bundle's declared parts: this app cannot read its system log
back, so the contents caption names available session and host records and
does not promise an app log.
