# Provider crates

*For developers changing how amux talks to Claude Code or Codex.*

Each provider is split into three layers, so that what the provider says,
how amux reaches it, and what amux does with it can each change on its
own:

| Layer | Claude | Codex | Holds |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protocol | [`claude-protocol`](../crates/claude-protocol/src/lib.rs) | [`codex-protocol`](../crates/codex-protocol/src/lib.rs) | Every message in both directions, as types, with a decoder and an encoder. Nothing else. |
| Host | [`claude`](../crates/claude/src/lib.rs) | [`codex`](../crates/codex/src/lib.rs) | Starting the provider and carrying its bytes: launch arguments, the process, the terminal, sockets, the transcript file, the hook command. |
| Client | the agent process and the [interpreters](INTERPRETERS.md); the spec driver in [`claude-specs`](../crates/claude-specs/src/driver/mod.rs) | the agent process and the [interpreters](INTERPRETERS.md); the client in [`codex`](../crates/codex/src/thread.rs) | Deciding what to send and what what was received means. |

## Protocol

A protocol crate is pure: it depends on `serde` and `serde_json` alone, and
the dependency policy refuses anything else, so the interpreters the phone
links can depend on it. It holds no process, socket or async code.

- `codex-protocol` types Codex's app-server JSON-RPC: what Codex sends
  (`ServerMessage`: notifications, requests for approval, input, tool calls
  and elicitations, and answers to amux's requests) and what amux sends
  (`ClientMessage`: requests, the `initialized` notification, and answers).
  An answer's result stays JSON until it is read as the response type of the
  request it answers, with `codex_protocol::result`.
- `claude-protocol` types three things Claude Code produces: its headless
  stream (`stream`: the frames it prints and the control requests and
  answers in both directions), the rows of the transcript file it writes in a
  terminal (`transcript`), and the payloads its hook command forwards
  (`hooks`).

Decoding is tolerant, because a provider update must not stop a running
agent. A message the crate does not know is kept whole as `Unknown`; an
unknown kind of a nested object, or an unknown spelling of a string value,
is kept as written; unknown fields of a known message are kept in its
`extra` (Codex) or `extensions` (Claude) map. Encoding writes all of it
back, so decoding and then encoding a recorded line gives the same JSON.
Each crate also has a `strict` decoder that refuses every one of those
fallbacks. The recording checks use it, which is how a change in what a
provider sends shows up: as a failed test naming the line, not as a quiet
`Unknown` in production.

## Host

A host crate knows how to start the provider and move bytes, and takes
every message type from its protocol crate.

- `claude` builds Claude Code's command line, hosts it in a terminal,
  follows the transcript file it writes, carries hook payloads from the
  hook command to the agent process over a socket, reaches Claude's
  messaging socket, and probes its version. The agent process uses it for
  terminal Claude.
- `codex` starts `codex app-server` and holds one connection to it: it
  writes requests built from `codex-protocol`, reads every line with
  `codex_protocol::decode`, answers each request with the line that answers
  it, and routes notifications and Codex's own requests to the thread they
  name. A request from Codex that the protocol crate cannot read is refused
  at once with "method not found", since nothing could answer it.

## Client

A client decides what to say and what a message means. In production the
client is the agent process with its interpreters: the interpreters read
provider facts and decide what to write, and the agent process carries those
writes. The [interpreters page](INTERPRETERS.md) describes them.

The recording tools are clients too:

- `codex`'s `Codex` and `Thread` drive a live Codex for the Codex
  specifications in [`codex-specs`](../crates/codex-specs/src/specs.rs) and
  its `codex-probe` recorder.
- The spec driver in `claude-specs`, shaped after Claude's published SDK,
  drives headless Claude for the Claude specifications and `claude-probe`.

Both replay their recordings strictly: the bytes they write must equal the
recorded ones, so a client that sends something different fails its
specification.

## Who checks what

| Check | Where | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| Recording corpus | `codex-protocol/tests/corpus.rs`, `claude-protocol/tests/stream_corpus.rs` and `pty_corpus.rs` | Every recorded line decodes strictly and encodes back to the same JSON. |
| Specification replay | `codex-specs/tests/spec_replay.rs`, `claude-specs/tests/spec_replay.rs` | The clients, on the protocol types, send exactly what the recordings show. |
| Fakes' shape check | [`provider-fakes/src/shape.rs`](../crates/provider-fakes/src/shape.rs) | Every frame a fake provider composes has a recorded shape and decodes strictly with its protocol crate. The fakes never use the host crates, so a host bug cannot hide behind code the fakes share. |
| Dependency policy | `scripts/check-dependency-policy.py` | The protocol crates stay pure, and only the crates listed there use them. |
