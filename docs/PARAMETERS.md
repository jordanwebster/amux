# Parameters

*For operators and developers tuning amux.*

Every number the design leaves open is a named value with one owner. This page
lists each one: the value amux starts with, what that value rests on, and where
it is set. Most starting values are reasoned rather than measured; the basis
column says which. When a measurement settles one, change the value where it
is set and the basis here.

Only a few values are in the configuration file; the rest are build constants
or fields of `node::Launch`, the struct the daemon starts agents and runs its
background work with. The installation configuration is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/amux/config.yaml` (by default `~/.config/amux/config.yaml`),
parsed as `settings::InstallationConfig` in
[`crates/settings/src/lib.rs`](../crates/settings/src/lib.rs). The keys this
page names are:

```yaml
retention:
  own_budget_mib: 2048      # own agents' rows, per profile
  replica_rows_mib: 256     # rows replicated from paired hosts, per runtime
  replica_blobs_mib: 512    # blob files fetched from paired hosts, per runtime
agent:
  grace_secs: 300           # how long an agent outlives its daemon
  drain_secs: 300           # how long an orphaned ask is held while draining
  facts_ring_mib: 4         # the interpreter's facts ring, both segments together
```

Agent settings are copied into each agent's `spec.<n>` at spawn and resume, so
a change affects the next incarnation, never a running agent. The phone's
embedded runtime reads no configuration file and runs with the defaults.

## The table

| Parameter | Owner | Starting value | Basis | Where it is set |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Journal segment size | agent | 1 MiB | Reasoned. Large enough that rotation, and the store flush that reclaiming a segment costs, is rare; small enough that reclaiming frees disk promptly. The flood workload's backlog ceiling assumes twenty agents each filling a segment a second. Not measured. | `DEFAULT_SEGMENT_BYTES` in [`crates/agent/src/host.rs`](../crates/agent/src/host.rs), used when the spec's `EffectiveConfig.journal_segment_bytes` is zero; the daemon sets that from `Launch.journal_segment_bytes` (zero by default, not a configuration key) |
| Terminal log segments kept | agent | 4 segments of 256 KiB | Reasoned: enough bytes to rebuild one full screen for a terminal that attaches late. Not measured. Only terminal Claude keeps a terminal log. | `PTY_SEGMENT_BYTES` and `PTY_SEGMENTS_KEPT` in [`crates/agent/src/host.rs`](../crates/agent/src/host.rs) |
| Grace after control-socket end of stream | agent, from spec | 5 minutes | Reasoned: minutes, enough to ride out a daemon update or crash restart, whose supervisor limits are 60 s to start and 30 s of backoff. | `agent.grace_secs` (`AgentSettings`), copied to `EffectiveConfig.grace_ms`; `DEFAULT_GRACE_MS` in [`crates/agent/src/host.rs`](../crates/agent/src/host.rs) when the spec leaves it zero |
| Drain deadline for an orphaned ask | agent, from spec | 5 minutes | Reasoned: the same order as the grace. | `agent.drain_secs`, copied to `EffectiveConfig.drain_ms`; the agent falls back to `DEFAULT_DRAIN_MS` (10 minutes) only when the spec leaves it zero |
| Facts ring size and segments kept | agent, from spec | 4 MiB across 2 segments | Reasoned: enough recent provider history to replay into a dump without keeping a second transcript. Not measured. | `agent.facts_ring_mib`, copied to `EffectiveConfig.facts_ring_bytes`; `DEFAULT_RING_BYTES` in [`crates/agent/src/host.rs`](../crates/agent/src/host.rs); the segment count is `KEEP = 2` in [`crates/agent/src/ring.rs`](../crates/agent/src/ring.rs) (see note 1) |
| Fan-out ring capacity | daemon | 512 events per agent; 1,024 for the inventory | Reasoned: hundreds of records, so a reader that pauses briefly keeps up while a stalled one is closed with `Lagged` and re-tails. The flood workload's ingest-lag budget (p99 under 250 ms) is stated as one ring's worth of work; that metric has no recorded baseline yet. | `Launch.fanout_capacity` and `Launch.inventory_capacity` in [`crates/node/src/runtime.rs`](../crates/node/src/runtime.rs); not a configuration key |
| Push notification delay | daemon | 30 s | Reasoned: tens of seconds, long enough that an answer from the desktop removes the notification before it is sent. | `Launch.notify_delay_ms` in [`crates/node/src/runtime.rs`](../crates/node/src/runtime.rs) (see note 2) |
| Own retention trim chunk | daemon | 4 MiB | Reasoned: a few MiB from the largest live agent per round, so a small overrun costs a small trim. | `Launch.retention_chunk_bytes` in [`crates/node/src/runtime.rs`](../crates/node/src/runtime.rs) |
| Own retention budget per profile | daemon config | 2,048 MiB | A generous multiple of the largest transcripts seen so far. Not measured against typical transcript sizes. Counts row bytes (`store::item_bytes`), not blob files, which go with their agent's directory. | `retention.own_budget_mib` (`RetentionSettings`) → `Launch.own_budget_bytes` |
| Replica budget per runtime (rows) | runtime config | 256 MiB | A round starting bound. Not measured. | `retention.replica_rows_mib` → `Launch.replica_budget_bytes` |
| Replica blob budget per runtime (files) | runtime config | 512 MiB, least recently read first | Reasoned: twice the row budget, since images dominate what is fetched. Not measured. | `retention.replica_blobs_mib` → `Launch.replica_blob_budget_bytes`; eviction in `store::BlobLru` ([`crates/store/src/blobs.rs`](../crates/store/src/blobs.rs)) |
| Latency budget, input to its reflection on screen | whole design | A few ms locally | By construction: one control-socket hop for the verdict, one commit, one fan-out. No workload measures it end to end yet (see note 3). | No single constant; the path is `ProfileRuntime::relay` in [`crates/node/src/relay.rs`](../crates/node/src/relay.rs) and `ProfileRuntime::ingest` in [`crates/node/src/runtime.rs`](../crates/node/src/runtime.rs) |
| Update check interval | supervisor | 1 hour | Reasoned: a corrective release reaches every host within the hour. | `Params.check_interval` in [`crates/node/src/supervisor/mod.rs`](../crates/node/src/supervisor/mod.rs); build constant |
| Rollback threshold K | supervisor | 3 starts that never activate | A guess to be revised when failed starts in the field say otherwise. | `Params.rollback_after` |
| Start deadline (spawn to prepared) | supervisor | 60 s | Reasoned: covers a migration and the daemon's read-only look at every agent directory. Not measured. | `Params.start_deadline` |
| Stop deadline (signal to kill) | supervisor | 30 s | Reasoned: a clean shutdown flushes every store before it sets the clean flag. | `Params.stop_deadline` |
| Restart backoff after activation | supervisor | 1 s doubling to 30 s; reset after 60 s up | Reasoned. | `Params.backoff_first`, `backoff_max`, `backoff_reset` |
| Composer and tool-server retry over an update | client, tool server | Clients reconnect after 250 ms, doubling to 5 s. The tool server retries a call for 5 s, backing off from 50 ms to 500 ms. | Reasoned: a daemon update takes a few seconds. An input already in flight is never retried; it shows as not confirmed. | `RECONNECT_FIRST_MS` and `RECONNECT_MAX_MS` in [`crates/ui-runtime/src/lib.rs`](../crates/ui-runtime/src/lib.rs); `RETRY_WINDOW` in [`crates/agent/src/tools.rs`](../crates/agent/src/tools.rs) |
| Driver trace length | ui-runtime | 400 events, memory only | Reasoned: a few hundred events cover the transitions a dump needs. The trace keeps between half this and this many. | `TRACE_EVENTS` in [`crates/ui-runtime/src/trace.rs`](../crates/ui-runtime/src/trace.rs) |
| Tail count on open (N) | client | Terminal: 40 rows. Phone: 200 rows. Both at most K. | Terminal: about a screen, with older rows paged as needed. Phone: the whole tail its own runtime keeps, so a chat opens with scroll-back already held. Not measured. | `PAGE` in [`crates/tui/src/chat/layout.rs`](../crates/tui/src/chat/layout.rs); `DEFAULT_TAIL` in [`crates/app-runtime/src/lib.rs`](../crates/app-runtime/src/lib.rs), overridable by `StartConfig.tail`; the daemon caps any tail at K in `open_subscription` |
| Replica tail and catch-up cap (K) | runtime | 200 rows | Reasoned: about an hour of a busy agent and several screens of scroll-back. An origin answers a delta of at most K rows and a Reset beyond it. Not yet tied to a measured size per row. | `TAIL_ROWS` in [`crates/node/src/runtime.rs`](../crates/node/src/runtime.rs) → `Launch.tail_rows`; also the floor own retention never trims below |
| Source reconnect backoff | runtime | 1 s doubling to 30 s while the host is reachable | Reasoned. | `Launch.source_backoff_ms` and `Launch.source_backoff_max_ms` |
| Lookahead above the screen before paging | client | Terminal: 40 rows. Phone: none; it pages when the top of the list comes into view. | Terminal: one page of held rows. | `LOOKAHEAD` in [`crates/tui/src/chat/layout.rs`](../crates/tui/src/chat/layout.rs); `ChatModel.reachedTop` in [`ChatModel.swift`](../apps/apple/Packages/AmuxCore/Sources/AmuxCore/ChatModel.swift) |
| Page size at an open collapsed run, and its cap | client | The run's length, at least one page, capped at 1,000 rows | Reasoned: a long run arrives in a few pages. | `RUN_PAGE_CAP` in [`crates/tui/src/chat/layout.rs`](../crates/tui/src/chat/layout.rs); `ChatModel.largestPage` and `pageSize` in [`ChatModel.swift`](../apps/apple/Packages/AmuxCore/Sources/AmuxCore/ChatModel.swift); the runtime returns at most 500 items per `Fetch` (see note 4) |
| Loading hint delay | client | 300 ms | Reasoned: a chat that fills at once never flashes the hint. | `LOADING_HINT_MS` in [`crates/tui/src/chat/mod.rs`](../crates/tui/src/chat/mod.rs); `ChatModel.loadingHintDelay` in [`ChatModel.swift`](../apps/apple/Packages/AmuxCore/Sources/AmuxCore/ChatModel.swift) |
| Session retention after last view | client | Phone: 5 minutes. Terminal: none; a chat's session closes when the terminal returns to the fleet. | Reasoned: long enough that going back to a chat is instant, short enough that the sessions a phone holds follow what the person looks at. | `StoreBundle.sessionRetention` in [`StoreBundle.swift`](../apps/apple/Packages/AmuxCore/Sources/AmuxCore/StoreBundle.swift) |
| WAL checkpoint interval | daemon | SQLite's automatic checkpoint (every 1,000 pages) | SQLite's default; amux sets no checkpoint pragma. Not measured. | Not set. Full checkpoints with a drive flush are taken explicitly by `Sqlite::flush_to_drive` in [`crates/store/src/sqlite.rs`](../crates/store/src/sqlite.rs): at clean shutdown and before journal segments are reclaimed |
| Put and fetch unary limit | wire | 64 MiB per RPC message; 16 MiB per link control message | Reasoned: room for blobs plus protobuf framing. | `CHANNEL_MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT` and `MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT` in [`crates/wire/src/lib.rs`](../crates/wire/src/lib.rs) (see note 5) |

## Notes

1. **Facts ring segments.** `agent.facts_ring_segments` is accepted in the
   configuration file, but the agent does not read it: the ring always keeps
   two segments, each half of `facts_ring_mib`.

2. **Push delay.** The shipped daemon and the phone runtime install
   `NoopSender` as their push sender, so notification rows fall due after this
   delay and are deleted without a push being sent. `HttpSender` in
   [`crates/node/src/outbox.rs`](../crates/node/src/outbox.rs) is the sender
   that posts to the account service.

3. **Latency.** The daemon relays an input's verdict only after the step that
   explains it is committed and broadcast, so the budget is the agent's journal
   write, one commit and one fan-out. The performance lane
   ([`crates/qualification/src/perf/flood.rs`](../crates/qualification/src/perf/flood.rs))
   has budgets for fleet and chat catch-up, ingest lag and backlog drain, but
   the only ingest figure recorded in the reference baseline
   ([`perf/baselines/desktop/Mac14,6.json`](../perf/baselines/desktop/Mac14,6.json))
   is the median cost per committed frame, about 21 µs. See
   [performance](PERFORMANCE.md).

4. **Page caps.** `Fetch` returns at most `MAX_PAGE` (500) items whatever the
   limit, and a peer's catch-up may ask for at most 10,000 rows (`MAX_CAP`),
   both in [`crates/node/src/serve.rs`](../crates/node/src/serve.rs). A client
   asking for a 1,000-row page at a collapsed run gets 500 and asks again.

5. **Blob size.** There is no separate limit on `PutBlob` or `GetBlob`: a blob
   is bounded by the RPC message limit. `BlobTooLarge` is declared in
   `amux.proto`, but no code path returns it.

## Related constants

These are not in the design's parameter list, but sit beside the values above
and are tuned the same way:

| Value | Starting value | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frames committed per ingest transaction | 512 | `INGEST_BATCH` in [`crates/node/src/runtime.rs`](../crates/node/src/runtime.rs). Sized from the measured ingest cost: at about 21 µs a frame, a batch holds the store for about 11 ms. |
| Fully ingested journal segments kept for dumps | 2 | `KEPT_SEGMENTS`, same file |
| Retention sweep interval | 10 minutes | `Launch.retention_interval_ms` |
| Agent process start deadline (spawn to Hello) | 20 s | `Launch.start_deadline_ms` |
| Agent stop deadline before the process group is killed | 30 s | `Launch.stop_deadline_ms` |
| Wait for an interpreter's verdict | 30 s | `Launch.reply_patience_ms`; past it the input is reported lost and the client shows it not confirmed |
| One write on an agent's control socket | 5 s | `Launch.ctl_write_ms` |
| Deliveries outbox retry | 30 s | `Launch.delivery_retry_ms` |
| Push retry after a failure | 60 s | `Launch.push_retry_ms` |
| Wait on an origin for a page | 10 s | `FETCH_PATIENCE` in [`crates/node/src/sources.rs`](../crates/node/src/sources.rs) |
| Largest journal or control-socket frame | 64 MiB | `journal::MAX_FRAME_BYTES`; `agent_dir::MAX_FRAME_BYTES` |
| Fixed per-row allowance in retention's byte count | 48 bytes | `ITEM_OVERHEAD_BYTES` in [`crates/store/src/lib.rs`](../crates/store/src/lib.rs) |

What these values govern is described in [the journal and store](JOURNAL_AND_STORE.md),
[the wire](WIRE.md), [the agent process](AGENT_PROCESS.md) and
[the supervisor](SUPERVISOR.md).
