//! Claude in a terminal. The facts are rows of Claude's transcript file,
//! hook payloads on the agent's hooks socket, the agent process's own launch
//! fact and the PTY's exit. Rows arrive whole, so nothing here streams.
//!
//! The transcript is the source of rows and hooks fill only its gaps. Every
//! row, tool calls included, is emitted from its transcript row in
//! transcript order: Claude writes a call's tool_use row as the call starts
//! and its tool_result row as it ends, so a running call is live and the
//! text that introduced a call sits above it. A prompt's row precedes the
//! rows of the turn it began, so nothing waits for it. Hooks carry what the
//! transcript never does: SessionStart names the transcript and the
//! session, PermissionRequest opens an ask, Stop closes what the turn left
//! open, and a Notification announces a dialog only the terminal can
//! answer. PreToolUse and PostToolUse only mark a call running, for the
//! activity line while its row is on the way; they never make a row.
//!
//! Terminal Claude has no protocol for asks, so this is the one interpreter
//! that infers them, and every inference rule lives in this module:
//!
//! - An ask opens on the PermissionRequest hook, which names no tool-use id,
//!   as a card carrying the hook's tool and input. Claude writes a gated
//!   call's row only once the call is decided (AskUserQuestion's once it is
//!   answered), so the card points at no row until the row with that tool
//!   and input lands, and then at that row.
//! - An ask closes on an answer sent through amux (outcome known), on the
//!   call's tool result (answered in the terminal: a refusal is a deny,
//!   anything else an allow), or on a later fact that proves the call is
//!   over without saying how: a new prompt, an interruption, the turn's
//!   end, a session change, the provider exiting, or a row from a later
//!   assistant message (outcome unknown, drawn dismissed, until the call's
//!   result says how it went). Nothing else closes one; a tick never does.
//! - A subagent's calls reach the hooks socket carrying its agent id and
//!   never reach the followed transcript; they are its steps, counted on
//!   the Agent row that started it, never rows of their own. An ask a
//!   subagent raises points at that Agent row and closes on the subagent's
//!   own PostToolUse for the call. A subagent Claude runs in the background
//!   answers the Agent call at once with launch metadata; its row stays
//!   running, across the end of the turn that launched it, until a user row
//!   of task-notification origin carries its result.
//! - A tool server's form or link that Claude shows in its own terminal is
//!   announced only by a Notification hook, which no hook can answer. It
//!   opens an unanswerable ask with an item of its own, the one item a hook
//!   makes besides SessionStart's session boundary, pointing at the call that was running (a tool server's, when
//!   one was). When that call's row has not landed yet, the item waits for
//!   it, so it sits below the call and the rows before it. An interrupt through amux closes it cancelled; that call's
//!   result, a row from a later assistant message, and the facts that close
//!   every ask close it dismissed.
//! - Claude's first screen may ask whether its folder is trusted; the
//!   agent process reports it before Claude counts as ready. It opens a
//!   question with its own item, answered through amux or closed by the
//!   session starting (trusted in the terminal) or Claude exiting.
//!
//! Terminal Claude offers no list of models, efforts or commands a program
//! could read, so its snapshot offers none and it takes no model or effort
//! input: a person types `/model <name>` or `/effort <level>` as any other
//! prompt, and the command's own transcript rows reflect it. The permission
//! mode changes only by cycling, since the cycle's order depends on how
//! Claude was launched.
