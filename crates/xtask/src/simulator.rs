//! Which device a simulator kind means, decided the same way the recipes'
//! Python decides it (`scripts/ios_simulators.py`).
//!
//! Every manifest entry and every `--simulator` argument names a kind, `golden`
//! or `small`, never a device. Inside a wt worktree the kind means the device
//! wt leased for this command, named in `WT_LEASE_IPHONE` or
//! `WT_LEASE_IPHONE_SMALL`; without a lease the tool refuses rather than drive
//! a device another checkout may be using. Outside a worktree, which is CI or a
//! bare checkout, it means the first device of the same naming scheme. A name
//! that is not a kind is taken as a device name, for driving an ad-hoc device
//! by hand.
