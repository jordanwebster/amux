//! Specifications for options: the things a caller decides before a session
//! opens.
//!
//! Options do not travel as protocol frames. They become command-line flags on
//! the Claude Code process, which is why each recording carries the spawn that
//! produced it. Two things are worth stating about them, and both are things a
//! recording can settle: that an option a caller set actually reached Claude
//! Code, and that Claude Code accepted it.
//!
//! The second is not a formality. Claude Code rejects a flag it does not know,
//! so a session that opens and answers is evidence that every flag the SDK
//! produced for these options is one Claude Code understands. A misspelled flag
//! name is otherwise invisible: the option simply does nothing.
