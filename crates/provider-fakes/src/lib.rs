//! Scripted stand-ins for the provider binaries amux hosts.
//!
//! Three binaries speak the real protocols: `fake-claude-pty` (a terminal
//! session that writes Claude's transcript JSONL, runs its hooks and serves
//! its messaging socket, without drawing a TUI), `fake-claude-sdk`
//! (stream-JSON over stdio) and `fake-codex` (the app server over stdio or,
//! for several clients at once, a Unix socket; and `resume <thread>`, the
//! terminal view an attach opens, a client of that socket with `--remote`).
//! Each plays an authored [`Script`] named by [`SCRIPT_ENV`], so tests run
//! whole agents offline and deterministically, or plays a recorded session
//! back verbatim ([`PLAYBACK_ENV`]).
//!
//! Two properties hold each fake to its provider. Every recording in the
//! claude-specs and codex-specs corpora plays back through the fake binary
//! over the transport hosts use (Codex's socket on Unix, stdio elsewhere)
//! byte for byte ([`conformance`]), so the fake's
//! transports and a recording's expressiveness as a script are the
//! provider's. And every frame the fake composes for an authored script
//! has a shape some recorded frame of the same kind has ([`shape`]), so a
//! fake that invents or drops fields drifts from its corpus and fails.
