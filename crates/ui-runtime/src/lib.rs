//! The session and fleet drivers: the only place an amux chat does I/O.

//! A [`Session`] owns one chat's Subscribe stream and feeds it into the pure
//! `ui_state::SessionState`; a [`Fleet`] does the same for the inventory.
//! Both call the local runtime through a [`client::Client`], reconnect on
//! their own clock, and keep a bounded trace for dumps. Nothing is
//! persisted: every open rebuilds from the runtime's rows.
