//! The agent directory, `agents/<id>/`: the whole contract between an agent
//! process and its daemon.
//!
//! The agent process holds the directory's lock for its lifetime, listens
//! on `ctl.sock` (and `pty.sock` for terminal clients) and appends to
//! `journal/`; the daemon writes `spec.<n>`, listens on `tools.sock`, dials
//! `ctl.sock` and reads the journal. This crate holds what both sides must
//! agree on: the names, the lock, the local sockets both kinds of socket
//! are, the framing on the control socket, and the clock every deadline on
//! either side runs on.
