//! The flood: twenty agents streaming at once on one host, and a
//! second runtime with no block opening the fleet and one chat.
//!
//! One run measures what the parameters table promises under that load:
//! how long the fleet and a chat take to reach CaughtUp on a runtime that
//! holds nothing yet, how far ingest trails the journals, how fast the
//! journals grow while the daemon is dead and how long it takes to drain
//! them after, what a replica's catch-up costs at a distance under and
//! over K, and each agent process's memory.
//!
//! "Full rate" is the fastest a real provider streams, not the fastest a
//! fake can write: see [`PACE_MS`]. What the daemon could take beyond that
//! is measured apart, with the agents unthrottled, as ingest's cost per
//! committed frame.
