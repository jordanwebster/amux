//! The chat vocabulary as terminal components, drawn from authored view
//! values rather than from sessions: every row kind as the feed draws it,
//! each ask body in the composer's box, the queued prompts, the composer's
//! states and the review page, once each. The renderer never sees the
//! provider kind, and ui-view's own goldens prove the projection per kind,
//! so one drawing of each component is the whole terminal claim.
//!
//! The component goldens and the PNG renderer both draw this set.
