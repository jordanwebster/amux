//! The chat's feed, one turn at a time: your message as a tinted block, the
//! agent's text in the reading ink, and each run of its tool steps folded
//! to one faint line between them, keeping in view a failure its turn left
//! unresolved. A run opens to its steps, one line each, and a step opens to
//! its detail. A run still under way shows its newest steps as they happen,
//! so the person sees the agent working, and folds once the agent speaks
//! again.
//!
//! Two columns carry everything, as on home: markers and the rail that joins
//! a run's steps sit on the left edge, words on the column after it.
//! Rows that are neither text nor a step (asks, errors, boundaries) keep
//! their own drawing from [`super::rows`].
