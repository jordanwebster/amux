//! One open chat: the client's view state over a session, the keys that
//! act on it, and the frame it draws.
//!
//! Everything here is ephemeral and the client's own: the anchor, the
//! expansion set keyed by item keys, the focused row, the draft, the ask
//! card's picks. Keys turn into [`ChatEffect`]s the event loop carries out
//! against the session; nothing in this module does I/O.
