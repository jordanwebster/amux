//! The profile store: one database per profile, the truth for this host's
//! own agents and a cache of its peers' agents, and the only history any
//! client on the machine reads, through its runtime.
//!
//! Own rows are written by [`Store::commit`] from an agent's journal: the
//! store assigns every record the agent's next revision and every new key
//! the next order, in journal order. Replica rows are written only by
//! [`Store::absorb`], which copies the origin's revisions and orders and
//! keeps the replica's rows one contiguous block ending at the origin's
//! newest (see [`Absorb`]). Both are single transactions.
//!
//! The logic lives here once, over the [`Tables`] primitives; [`Sqlite`]
//! (the profile file) and [`InMemory`] (tests, replay) differ only in how
//! they keep rows, so one conformance suite holds both to the same reads.
