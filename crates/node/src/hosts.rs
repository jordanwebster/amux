//! The one host set the inventory carries: this host, every host the
//! profile trusts with its presence and the generation this store last
//! recorded for it, and the machines discovery has found in this profile's
//! scope that nobody has paired, as candidates.
//!
//! A trusted host is in every snapshot whatever its presence; only
//! untrusting it removes it, so no reconnect can make a client forget an
//! agent because its host went quiet. Candidates come and go with
//! discovery. The set is recomputed on the replication manager's tick and
//! published as HostEntry and HostRemoved deltas while the store is held,
//! the lock SubscribeInventory reads the published set under, so an
//! opening and the deltas after it describe one sequence.
