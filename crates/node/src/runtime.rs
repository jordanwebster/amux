//! One profile runtime: a complete amux with its own host id, store and
//! agents. This module is its agent registry: spawn, resume, stop, delete
//! and rename, and the startup sweep that rebuilds the registry from disk.
//!
//! The registry keeps one [`AgentHandle`] per agent whose process is live
//! (or whose directory is locked by one): the directory, the control
//! connection, and the tools socket the agent's MCP server dials. Nothing
//! here is persisted; after a restart the sweep rebuilds it from the agent
//! directories and the store's rows.
//!
//! Each handle has one watcher task. It dials `ctl.sock`, reads the Hello,
//! ingests on every Nudge, and when the connection ends works out whether
//! the process is gone (its lock is free) or the connection merely
//! dropped (it redials). A process that is gone has its journal remainder
//! ingested, its row marked exited and its tools socket removed.
