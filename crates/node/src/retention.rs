//! Own retention: keeps the profile's own rows under their budget.
//!
//! The store decides what goes (exited agents whole, least recently active
//! first, never an exited child whose parent is live; then the largest live
//! agent trimmed a chunk at a time, never below its newest rows) and says
//! which agents it removed. The daemon then does what the store cannot:
//! ends their streams, tells the fleet they are gone and deletes their
//! directories, which takes their blobs with them. The sweep runs when the
//! background work starts and then on its interval, on the runtime's clock.
