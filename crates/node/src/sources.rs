//! Peer sources: how a runtime keeps its replicas of other hosts' agents
//! current.
//!
//! Every trusted host has one follower. While the host is reachable it
//! holds the host's SubscribeInventory stream: at the stream's CaughtUp it
//! records the host's generation, writes the rows the host lists and
//! drops the ones it no longer lists, and only then marks the host ready.
//! That is what "reachable" means for a source.
//!
//! Every replica agent of a ready host may have one source: one Subscribe
//! to the origin. The agents the store remembers of a host get theirs as
//! the host's inventory is subscribed, in the same flight, so a launch
//! reconciles in one round trip to each host rather than two; the
//! inventory's CaughtUp confirms them, and drops any for an agent the host
//! no longer lists. With no block it asks for a tail of K, with one for what
//! came after its cursor, capped at K, naming the origin generation the
//! cursor was taken under; the origin answers a delta when it fits and the
//! generation is the one it runs, and a Reset and a fresh tail otherwise.
//! Every stream opens with the origin's generation, which the block takes
//! at its Reset, so a rewound origin (an unclean reboot mints the same
//! orders and revisions again for different content) resets each of its
//! replicas on that replica's own stream, forgetting every row of the old
//! generation. The source holds a catch-up until the origin's
//! CaughtUp and then absorbs it in one go, so the block is never left
//! half-replaced by a stream that died midway; the cursor moves to the
//! revision CaughtUp carries, then per live record. Records are absorbed
//! before they are broadcast. A stream that ends is Detached to local
//! subscribers and retried after the cursor with backoff on the policy
//! clock while the host stays reachable. A source for an exited agent
//! closes once its catch-up has landed.
//!
//! Which agents get a source is the runtime's [`SourcePolicy`], read by
//! one sweep after every inventory catch-up and change and once when the
//! policy changes; a client's Subscribe opens one for any agent the policy
//! skipped. Under `OnDemand` the sweep keeps exactly the agents a client is
//! subscribed to.
