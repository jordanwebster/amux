//! Fan-out: one bounded broadcast channel per agent, and one for the
//! inventory.
//!
//! Ingest publishes each committed record once, wrapped in an Arc, after
//! its transaction commits; every subscription holds its own cursor into
//! the channel's ring. Publishing never waits: a subscription that falls
//! more than the capacity behind is told it lagged and closed, and its
//! client re-tails from the store, which is where late arrivers catch up.
//! The store is never a buffer for a live stream.
