//! The one fold for tool steps. A run is every tool step between two pieces
//! of what the agent or the person put in the transcript: a turn reads as
//! the agent's text with its work in between, and a client folds each run
//! of that work to one line, what it did, not every call. Thinking, retry
//! notices, a subagent's own steps and items that draw nothing pass through
//! a run; anything else ends it.
//!
//! Membership is the session's run index; this module states it on each
//! row, so any client's list gets the fold with the rows. A client chooses
//! between showing every step, hiding them and folding them, and holds
//! which runs are open.
//!
//! A run's ends move with the window: a page of older history grows it
//! below, and a window following the newest row trims its oldest steps. So
//! a client holds an open run by one of its steps, not by either end: a run
//! is open when the open set holds any of its members. Opening holds its
//! newest step, which no page moves; [`keep_open_runs`] moves each hold to
//! its run's newest step as the run grows, so a trim never takes it.
