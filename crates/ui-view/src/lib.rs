//! Pure content values both amux clients compose. Every view is a function
//! of a [`ui_state::SessionState`] or [`ui_state::FleetState`] and the
//! client's explicit arguments (an order range, keys, an option struct, an
//! expansion set), never a size. Views carry typed facts; wording, geometry,
//! theme and animation belong to each renderer.
//!
//! Rows are items: the row id is the item key and never moves, and a run of
//! tool steps is an attribute on its members, so paging and streaming only
//! ever add ids at the two edges.
