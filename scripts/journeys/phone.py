"""The phone journey driver.

Starts a served topology with `testnet serve`, installs the debug app fresh on
the leased simulator and launches it with its door, the net's discovery
scope, a loopback direct-link listener and, when the net has one, the served
relay. It then acts only as a person would, through door verbs a person's
action maps to: tap, type, paste, pair by the link or code the machine
printed, and appearance. It judges by what the hosts recorded (the served
net's Chat, Inventory and ProviderInput verbs) and by compared screens: the
simulator's display PNG against journeys/goldens/phone/<story>/<label>.png
with `xtask golden diff` under the pinned simulator's system-chrome masks,
and the door's element geometry against <label>.elements.txt. Stories supply
the acts and the assertions; UPDATE_JOURNEY_GOLDENS=1 rewrites the goldens
that differ.
