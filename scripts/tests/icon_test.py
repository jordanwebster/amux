"""Check the app has an icon the App Store will accept.

Apple rejects an upload whose bundle carries no icon — code 90022 for a
missing 120x120 image and 90713 for a missing `CFBundleIconName` — and
nothing in a simulator build notices, because the simulator shows an app
without an icon quite happily. The first time the gap appears is at
validation, after an archive, an export and a signing round trip. So it is
checked here instead, from the sources the icon is compiled out of.
