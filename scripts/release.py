"""Take the iPhone app from a clean checkout to a signed, exported .ipa.

Everything a release needs is here and nothing beyond it: this script bumps
the two version numbers, archives the app against the distribution
configuration, exports it, has Apple validate it, and only then commits the
numbers and cuts the tag that records them. It never pushes and
never uploads: Apple sees the build only as a validation, which spends no
build number and shows the build to nobody. docs/RELEASE.md explains why each
rule is what it is; this is the rule enforced.

Three ways to run it:

  --preflight   report every input a release needs and stop, reaching Apple
                for nothing.
  --rehearse    archive, export and validate with the numbers the next
                release would use, writing nothing to the tree and cutting no
                tag, so it can be run as often as you like.
  (neither)     write the numbers, archive, export and validate, and only
                then commit the numbers and cut the tag.

The Team ID comes from the untracked ios/Signing.local.xcconfig and the App
Store Connect key from this Mac's login keychain; neither is ever written to a
file this repository tracks.
