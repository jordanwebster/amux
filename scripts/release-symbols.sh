# Splits a release build of amux into the binary a release ships and the symbols
# it keeps beside it, both named for the release asset:
#
#   release-symbols.sh <target> <asset> <out-dir>
#
# The shipped binary carries no symbols; the symbols file carries the line
# tables, matched to the binary by its build identity (the GNU debuglink on
# Linux, the Mach-O UUID on macOS, the PDB signature on Windows), so a crash
# address from a shipped binary can be symbolicated later.
