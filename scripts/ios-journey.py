"""Run shared journey stories on the iPhone app.

`scripts/ios-journey.py [story...]`: each story from journeys/manifest.json
that lists the phone among its clients, against the served topology it names
for the phone (`phone_topology`, else `topology`), on the leased simulator,
driven through the app's door the way a person drives it. Screens are
compared with reviewed goldens under journeys/goldens/phone/<story>/
(UPDATE_JOURNEY_GOLDENS=1 rewrites them) and the hosts are asked what they
recorded. Results land in target/journeys/phone/<story>. With no story named,
every story written here runs; `--native` runs the phone's own stories, the
ones the manifest declares for the phone alone.
