"""Carry a real App Store sandbox purchase from a phone to the account
service, and read back what the account may then do.

An App Store sandbox transaction exists in exactly one place: a physical
iPhone signed into a sandbox Apple Account, running a development-signed
build. Apple's engineers say so plainly — sandbox sign-in is not supported on
the Simulator — and the StoreKit configuration this repository commits is
StoreKit Testing, whose transactions are signed by the local test certificate
and are not sandbox transactions. So this recipe never runs on a simulator and
never invents a transaction: when the phone, the signing or the account is not
here, it says which and stops.

Two ways to run it:

  --preflight            report what is present and missing on this Mac and
                         exit 0, touching neither StoreKit, the store nor
                         amux.sh.
  --transaction-file P   post a transaction already captured on a phone
                         through POST /api/purchases as the device QA
                         account, and read the two answers back.
  (neither)              build and install on the connected phone, ask the
                         person to buy, and watch amux.sh until the purchase
                         lands or a bound elapses.

The account is the device QA account and only that: the one
AMUX_QA_DEVICE_EMAIL names, in the environment or in the operator's untracked
file. There is no built-in address, and the end-to-end account the other
recipes use is refused. Nothing that identifies the account reaches the
output, an evidence file or any committed file.
