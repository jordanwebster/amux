"""The pinned simulators: which device a recipe drives, and how it is pinned.

Every capture and measurement names a *kind* of device, ``golden`` or
``small``, never a device. Which device a kind means is decided here, once:

- Inside a wt worktree the device is the one wt leased for this command,
  named in ``WT_LEASE_IPHONE`` or ``WT_LEASE_IPHONE_SMALL``. A recipe that
  reaches this module inside a worktree without a lease is refused, because
  driving a device another checkout may be using is exactly the corruption
  the lease exists to prevent.
- Outside a worktree, which is CI or a bare checkout, the device is the first
  of the same naming scheme, so the only difference between the two
  environments is whether anything coordinates.

wt calls the subcommands at the bottom to create, probe and prepare a device;
the recipes call ``ready`` to get the udid of the device their kind means.
