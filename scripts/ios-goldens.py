"""Photograph the phone's whole screens through the served door and compare
each with its golden, in light and in dark.

`scripts/ios-goldens.py [--only ID]... [--update] [--perturb TOKEN] [--review DIR]`

The screens are the `screens` half of apps/apple/Goldens/manifest.json. Each
is reached the way a person reaches it, on the phone driver: the manifest's
topology is served with `testnet serve`, the debug app is installed fresh on
the leased simulator, the desk is paired by the code it printed, and the app
is tapped to each screen while the served net makes the desk's agents do
what the screen needs. A screen is judged by the display's pixels and the
door's element geometry against apps/apple/Goldens/<screen>.<appearance>.png
and <screen>.elements.txt (both appearances share one geometry). A screen
with frames (origin-rewind's before and after) has a golden per frame.

Every screen is drawn with the app's reduce-transparency flag on, turned on
through the door before the first screen, so each frosted surface is flat:
a raised fill with a hairline rim, what a person who turned Reduce
Transparency on sees. Liquid Glass and material are finished by the render
server on its own schedule, out of the app's sight, so a photograph of them
is not a fixed picture a tight comparison can hold.

`--only ID` photographs just the screens named; the way through every other
screen is still taken, so each is reached in the same state. Tab pages a
pushed page covers are left out of the geometry. `--update` rewrites every
golden that differs and leaves the rest alone. `--perturb TOKEN` moves one design colour
token (or, named `needs-you-dot`, takes that one small mark away) before
anything is drawn and fails unless every photograph comes back different
with a difference image: what proves the comparison would notice.
`--review DIR` takes the same way with the flag off and writes every screen,
glass and all, to DIR as <screen>.<appearance>.png for a person to look at;
nothing is compared and no golden is read or written.

The components half of the manifest is photographed in-process by
`just ios component-snapshots`; this script only reads its screens.
