"""Measure the iPhone app on this Mac's simulator: `just ios perf`.

The optimised `Measured` app, which keeps the driving door, runs against the
served performance network (`qualification::perf::phone`: three machines on
the phone's local network, forty agents, one conversation a thousand rows
long that streams on cue). Every packet between the phone and a machine
crosses a gate the run can delay, so reconciliation is measured over a
household network's latency as well as over none. Every number is taken by
the app itself and read back through the door; this script only arranges the
workload, keeps the samples, judges them against the budgets below and the
enrolled Mac's baseline, and writes the report.

docs/PERFORMANCE.md, "The phone", is the reference: the tables there are
checked against BUDGETS and MACHINES here by scripts/tests/ios_perf_test.py.

  --describe        say which machine this is and whether its baseline exists
  --only GROUP      one of cold, reconciliation, streaming, idle; repeatable
  --baseline        record this run's medians as the machine's baseline, after
                    every budget passes; needs a whole run
  --flat            draw every surface flat (the reduce-transparency setting) for
                    the whole run: a diagnostic, never a baseline, that says how
                    much of a number is the glass
