"""Reaching the real amux.sh as a QA account, from this Mac.

The sign-in here is the app's sign-in: the same authorization-code exchange
with PKCE, the same client, redirect and scopes, driven against production.
Two recipes need it — one that only reports what an account may do, and one
that carries a purchase from a phone to the account service — so it lives in
one place rather than being copied and drifting.

Nothing that identifies an account ever reaches the output. Addresses are
masked, and the password, the authorization code and every token are read,
used and dropped.
