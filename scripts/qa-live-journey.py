"""The whole product, once, against the real one: an entitled account, the
production relay, a daemon on this Mac and a real agent answering a question
asked from the phone.

Every other journey in this repository runs against a relay started beside it,
with credentials a harness minted. That proves the app; it cannot prove the
production handshake, because the thing being validated on the other side is a
signature nobody local can produce. This signs a QA account into
`https://amux.sh` exactly as the phone does, hands the app the session it got,
and then stands back: the app asks the account service what it may do, asks it
for a relay credential, and dials the relay that credential names. Nothing
here tells the app where to go.

The machine on the other side is this checkout's own daemon, on a profile made
for the run and destroyed after it, signed in through the CLI's device-code
flow with the same account. The agent is a real Claude session and the
exchange is one question with a one-word answer, because it spends real money.

    wt run qa-live-journey

Evidence a person runs by hand, never a test and never in CI. Nothing that
identifies the account reaches the output: the address is masked, the account
identifier and every token are replaced wherever they would otherwise appear,
and the password is read out of the login keychain at the moment it is needed
and dropped.
